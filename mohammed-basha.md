## **Types of Stores:**

Depending upon the nature of business, location of action, raw material, market place etc. Stores' Layout is planned. Hence it is necessary to have a look at different types / classification of Stores:  


**There are basically two broad classes:**

1. **Functional Stores:**
It depends on the use to which the material is put – chemicals, tools, raw materials stores, etc.

1. **Physical Stores:**
It depends on the size and location – Central stores, Sub-stores, Transit stores, Site stores etc.


_**Functional Stores can be further classified as:**_

* **Raw materials store:**
This is where raw materials used in the factory are stored. Usually, this is the largest kind and the location should be such that it is situated alongside a railway, canal or river. Where the deliveries are by road, there must be adequate space for trucks to move, turn and park. If sufficient provision is not made for quick and easy loading or unloading, heavy demurrage can result. Not all such stores need covered sheds. For example, an engineering company whose raw material is steel will store the steel plates in an open yard. Similarly, a powerhouse using coal or a fertiliser plant using sulphur will store material in the open. A refinery will store its crude-oil in tanks.
In certain cases where the raw materials may be explosive dangerous or poisonous in nature, complete segregation will be necessary.

* **Production Store:**
Production also requires a large number of materials, generally called "consumables", - eye-shields, cutting oils, abrasives, gloves, aprons, jigs, small tools etc. A store stocking such items is called a Production Store.

* **General Store:**
Various kinds of miscellaneous items like paints, brushes, cleaning materials, wood and spirit are kept here. In some cases where there is no Production Store, the materials mentioned in (ii) are kept in the General Store.
