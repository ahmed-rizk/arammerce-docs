# E-Commerce Features

## Navigational Models 
    - How do users know where they are now?
    - Where to go next?
    - And how to get there from here? (target page)

 - ## 1. Navigational Models/Patterns 
    - I think we will use  **Fat Menus** 
    - becouse the site has many pages 
    -  The site or app has many pages in many categories
    - Your users are comfortable with drop-down menus (click to see them) or fly-outs (roll over them with the pointer)

- ## 2. Page content

  * ### Page Elements Patterns
    > Page layout is the art of manipulating the user’s attention on a page to convey meaning

  * I think we will use  **Visual Framework** pattern
    > Design each page to use the same basic layout, colors, and stylistic elements

  * And use also Titled Sections when we have a lot of content to show
  
------------------

- ## 3. Lists of Things Patterns
    * ### Thumbnail Grid 
    > Arrange a list of visually interesting items into a “small multiples” grid of thumbnail images
